Overview

Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that allows us to
build tree structures by grouping similar clusters based on their
similarities. Each node in the tree represents data that have the least
dissimilarity between them. By calculating the distance matrix between
the clusters, we are able to group the clusters and then visualize our
data by using a dendrogram. The height of each branch of the tree shows
the degree of similarity and dissimilarity between the clusters and the
strength of correlation \[1\]. The clusters (nodes of the tree) that are
placed in the same level in the tree are more similar to each other than
those placed on a higher or lower level. Although hierarchical
clustering is a convenient and easy way of organizing scattered data, is
it often hard to perform meaningful data analysis on the end result of
this clustering technique, especially when we are dealing with large
data. In order to have accurate dendrograms, we need to maximize the
similarities between the data in each cluster and minimize the
similarity among the clusters.

One of the challenges in hierarchical clustering analysis is the
calculation of the distance matrix. While there are many popular ways to
calculate this, using Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance, we need
to know our data inside and out in order to make a decision on which
calculating approach provides the most accurate result based on the type
and size of data we are working with.

A well designed clustering algorithm can provide an easy to understand
tree construct for the reader to draw quick and straightforward
conclusions when it comes to cluster analysis.

Applications in Biological Sciences

Hierarchical clustering is a useful technique when we are working with
biological data. We can group genes with similar expressions into
clusters and use appropriate clustering algorithms to convert noisy
scattered data into an organized cluster tree for gene expression
profiling. Other applications in biological data analysis, including
finding gene sequence similarities among data gathered at experimental
level, identify genes that are coregulated. Additionally, they classify
independent biological pathways and build the famous phylogenetic tree.
We can also use hierarchical clustering techniques to track where a
viral outbreak originated from. Using other clustering and modeling
techniques along with hierarchical clustering often results in better
classification of data as we need to reduce the amount of noise and
number of outliers.

Algorithm

There are **two types of basic clustering algorithms** to build our tree
structure and they are exactly reverse of each other. We can use a
bottom-up algorithm for agglomerative (or linkage) clustering or a
top-down algorithm for divisive clustering. While both use cluster
similarity to either merge or divide two clusters, divisive clustering
is a rare approach since it is more complex to partition the (global)
data, and once the division is done, we are able to reverse it.

**Divisive Clustering**

In divisive clustering, all the data points start in the same cluster
and then they are divided into smaller clusters using a **parametric
clustering algorithm** and the process is repeated until we hit the
desired number of clusters. Divisive clustering is more efficient in
case of a predetermined number of clusters we want to break our global
into.

**Agglomerative Clustering**

In Agglomerative (linkage) clustering each data point starts in its own
cluster. By using greedy algorithms, the clusters that are most similar
to each other are merged together until one cluster is formed. The merge
operation is done monotonically \[3\]. In a bottom-up algorithm we do
not need to predetermine the number of clusters, but sometimes we need
to cut the hierarchy at some point to work with only those sets of
clusters that are in the same level of hierarchy.

The following figure shows how we can use this technique to visualize
ten gene sequences with different (dissimilar) gene expressions in three
separate experiments. \[4\] Each axis represents experiment 1, 2 or 3.
Each data point is a three dimensional vector showing expression levels.
Merging similar sequences requires us to calculate the geometric
distance between each data point.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After calculating the N x N similarity matrix, where N is the number of
data points (N=10 in figure1), the algorithm iteratively merges in the
most similar data points in N-1 number of steps until there is only one
vector left. In each iteration the similarity matrix needs to be stored
in the memory to be accessed in the next step and then update the
similarity matrix to be restored again. This is why this technique is
not efficient and cannot be used for large data.

It's also important to note that, how we calculate the distance matrix
for merging or dividing different clusters will have an impact on the
outcome of our algorithm as well as, our interpretation of data - as it
may introduce noise or outliers.

Distance Measures

There are several different ways to calculate the **measure of
distance**, but for now we will focus on the most common methods - such
as Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance.

**Euclidean distance**

Euclidean distance is the most **well-known clustering calculation
method**. It is a distance that is the length of a line between the two
points in euclidean space. It can be calculated from the Cartesian
coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem, called the
Pythagorean distance and it gives the magnitude of the two points. The
euclidean distance is calculated as: $d(p,q)\  = \ $

**Manhattan distance**

Manhattan distance is a distance measure that is not widely used. It is
a distance between two data points in a grid-like path. It is also
called the **“taxicab” metric**. The Manhattan distance is the sum of
absolute differences. The Manhattan distance is calculated as p~1~ at
(x~1~, y~1~) and p~2~ as: (x~2~,
y~2~)$\  = \ |X_{1} - X_{2}| + \ ... + |X_{1} - Y_{2}|$.

**Cosine Similarity**

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors
projected in a multi-dimensional space. In a multi-dimensional space,
the co**sine similarity captures the orientation or the angle of two
vectors**, not the magnitude. The cosine similarity is advantageous
because it can calculate how similar the points are irrespective of
their size. Additionally, this method is best used for bigger size
inputs. For example, if the two similar points are far apart because of
the size, they could still count on having angles between them. Smaller
the angle is the higher the similarity. Therefore, it is more applicable
to the real world.

Linkage Methods In Hierarchical Clustering

In the beginning, we explained both agglomerative hierarchical
clustering and divisive hierarchical clustering. Within the
agglomerative hierarchical clustering, there are several methods,
complete-linkage, single-linkage, and average-linkage. Since
complete-linkage and single-linkage are two similar but different
methods, it is better to explain both as the comparisons.

**Complete-Linkage and Single-Linkage**

Complete-linkage and single-linkage both start each element in a cluster
of its own individuals. The clusters are then sequentially combined into
larger clusters until all elements end up being in the same cluster. At
each step, the two clusters separated by the shortest distance are
combined. The 'shortest distance' differentiates between the different
agglomerative clustering methods. In complete-linkage clustering, we
merge the two clusters that are the farthest elements in clusters. On
the other hand, in single-linkage hierarchical clustering, we merge the
two clusters that are closest elements in clusters. Mathematically, the
complete linkage function — the distance
$D(X,Y)\  = \ max_{\text{x\ } \in \ X,\ y\  \in Y}\ d(x,y)$ and single
linkage function - the distance $D(X,Y)\  = \ min\ d(x,y)$ Where,
$d(x,y)\ $is the distance between $x \in \ X,\ y\  \in \text{\ Y}$and X
and Y are two sets of clusters.

**Average-Linkage**

Average-linkage uses the distance between two clusters as defined as the
average of distances between all pairs of objects. In the average
linkage method, D(x,y) is computed as
$D(x,y)\  = \ T_{\text{xy}}\ /\ (\ Nx\ *\ Ny)$. Where Txy is the sum of
all pairwise distances between cluster x and cluster y. N\_x and N\_y
are the sizes of the clusters x and y, respectively*.* In the average
link, the two clusters x and y are merged and formed new clusters within
the average pairwise distance and so on.

**Understanding the Time Complexity of Linkage**

To compare the efficiency among these agglomerative hierarchical
clustering, it is easier to compare time complexity of each
complete-linkage, single-linkage, and average-linkage methods.

The time complexity of **complete-linkage** clustering is O($n^{2}$ log
n). This algorithm is to compute the $n^{2}$ distance metric and then
sort the distances for each data point. After each merge iteration, the
distance metric can be updated in O(n). The process of picking the next
pair to merge is by finding the smallest distance that is still eligible
for merging. This can be done by traversing the n sorted lists of
distances, which takes $n^{2}$ traversal steps. This all takes up
O($n^{2}$ log n).

The time complexity of **single-linkage** clustering is O($n^{2}$). To
start off, compute all distances in O($n^{2}$). While doing this, find
the smallest distance for each data point and keep them in a
next-best-merge array and we then find the smallest distance in the
next-best-merge array in each of the n-1 merging steps. Then merge the
two clusters, and update the distance matrix in O(n). Finally, we update
the next-best-merge array in O(n) in each step. There, it takes
O($n^{2}$).

The time complexity of **average-linkage** clustering is O($n^{2}$log
n). First, compute all $n^{2}$ similarities for the single clusters. In
each of O(n) merge iterations, identify the pair of clusters with the
highest cohesion in O(n), merge the pair, and update cluster centroids,
gammas and cohesions of the O(n) possible mergers of the just created
cluster with the remaining clusters. For each cluster, we also need to
update the sorted list of merge candidates by deleting the two just
merged clusters and inserting its cohesion with the just created
cluster. This iteration takes O(n log n). Therefore, overall time
complexity is then O($n^{2}$ log n).

As a result, it is seen that they all have very poor time complexities…

Illustrative Example

Hierarchical clustering **creates a tree of clusters**. Hierarchical
clustering, not surprisingly, is well suited to hierarchical data, such
as taxonomies. In the example image, shown above, we can see the
clusters being formed based on animal type. This is then outputted as a
dendrogram, showing its leaves and root.

Hierarchical Clustering versus Other Clustering Techniques

**K-Means Clustering**

When comparing this algorithm to other clustering algorithms, it is seen
that K-Means clustering is definitely a top competitor in terms of
speed. Given that the time complexity of K-Means is **linear**, while
that of Hierarchical Clustering is **quadratic**. Additionally, K-Means
produces tighter clusters compared to Hierarchical Clustering Method,
giving K-Means a better advantage when it comes to reading its outputs.

**Affinity Propagation Clustering**

Affinity propagation is a newer clustering algorithm that finds a set of
data-points that best summarize the data using a graph-based approach
that lets its points ‘vote’ on their preferred ‘exemplar’. \[8\]
Affinity Propagation has some advantages over Hierarchical Clustering.
In using this ‘graph-based’ approach, **exemplar voting** means that the
user won’t need to specify the number of clusters. Just like
Hierarchical Clustering, Affinity Propagation tends to be very slow.
When it is used to run on large datasets, it is still difficult to
understand our data based on the final clusters.

**Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)**

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm. The main objective
algorithm is that the neighborhood of each point in a cluster must have
a minimum number of points. In addition, DBSCAN has proved extremely
**efficient in detecting outliers and handling noise**. Using DBSCAN
also works well with handling clusters of different shapes and sizes as
well as very large datasets, thus giving this algorithm a higher
advantage when it comes to analyzing its data in comparison to
Hierarchical Clustering.

**Mean Shift Clustering**

Like Hierarchical Clustering , Mean-shift clustering does not require
specifying the number of clusters in advance. The **number of clusters
is determined by the algorithm with respect to the data**. In addition,
Mean Shift has more intuitive and meaningful parameters as well as a
better scalability in principle, giving it a slightly better advantage
in comparison to that of Hierarchical Clustering.

Summary

Machine Learning tools have overall helped us understand more on the
emerging research issue in data mining due its variety of applications.
With the advent of many data clustering algorithms in recent years and
its extensive use in an extensive variety of applications, which include
image processing, computational biology, medicine and more – it has led
to an increase of popularity for these algorithms. Hierarchical
Clustering, being one of them, has been a tool used to group similar
objects into groups called clusters and create informative outputs.

From its measuring metrics, to how Hierarchical Clustering works, we’ve
been given a better understanding of why people might choose to use this
algorithm. And although Hierarchical Clustering is useful for people
just learning how to cluster data types – from its limitations we can
see few of the many disadvantages that come with using it. Overall, this
algorithm gives us a very easy way to implement data and provides us
with the best result in some cases.
